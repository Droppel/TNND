The program can be started by executing: "python main.py" in the folder where main.py and rbfnet.py reside.
A few parameters can be changed at the start of the main function (Line 6-10):

outputSize: The size of the output vector
stepSize: The amount of space between two RBF Centers
seed: The seed
learnRate: The learning rate etha
iterations: The amount of training iterations

We have chosen to distribute the centers uniform.
The program needs numpy and maplotlib to run.
